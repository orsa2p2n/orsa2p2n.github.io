**CastleDB** is a tool initially developed by [Nicolas Cannasse](https://github.com/ncannasse/castle), made to handle structured static data. Everything that is usually stored in XML or JSON files can be stored and modified with CastleDB instead.

Eventually, support for the tool as a standalone was dropped, in favor of implementing it as a library as part of [HIDE](https://github.com/heapsio/hide).

This fork's goal is to provide a standalone, stable version of the CastleDB editor, with added features.

It is based on [Motion Twin's `multifile` branch](https://github.com/motion-twin/castle/tree/multifile), which saves data in multiple files instead of only one, making collaborative work easier.
